# MakeMkvKey
A small shell script to automatically get the newest MakeMkv Beta Key on Linux

# Installation
Put the script somewhere in your path and make it executable.

# Usage
Run the script. If a new beta key is available it will show the old and new key to you and ask if you want to replace it. If you wish to replace it the expiration date of the new key will also be shown. If the key is already up to date or you choose to not replace the key the script will just terminate.
